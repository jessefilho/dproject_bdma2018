# Introduction 

 Not long ago, there was a strong belief that the internet was killing the music industry. For years now, the industry has failed to keep up with the rapid pace of technological advancement and  barely had any understanding of their audience, who was buying their CDs, or cassettes.(Monnappa)

With streaming services taking over, these companies found ways to track the listening habits of users and have access to detailed information such as when, how, where, and who is listening to what.

The aim of the industry, now, is to use these customer behavior insights together with knowledge of the music itself, which is made possible only with Big Data. The raw music that is produced is essentially like unstructured data. In the digital era, this raw music can be easily digitized and analyzed.

As part of our master degree â€˜s program , we choose to work on the design and implementation of a business intelligence system(moss2003business) supporting the analysis of songs.
Our objective is to analyze the current music streaming industry and more precisely the songs and the artists' popularity. We decided to bring the subject closer to us by focusing on French artists.

# How to running this project?

To have access to the currently database, I must be student of Tours University, otherwise you can download our data schema without data.

If you are student of Tours University, I should have access to University OpenVPN:

Make sure that you are properly connected at OpenVPN networking, then you will have all access to Postgres DB(via PGADMIN) and [Pentaho BI SERVER](http://10.195.25.10:54585/pentaho/Login).

If it doesn't works, means that the VM was murdered by a nefarious adm. =( 
In this case, if have questions, you can contact me at jessefilhojfnf@gmail.com
   

 more detail in the future.
